Why did I create NotaMy?
-------------------------

It all started with my passion for Linux and cybersecurity.

Back when I was getting into CTFs and wargames, I had a constant problem:
where the hell do I put all the info I find — and how do I keep it organized?

I mean, every time I needed something, I ended up digging through
a jungle of random files and folders spread all over my system.

On top of that, I work mostly in the terminal, and I really didn’t want
to keep switching between tools or opening GUI apps just to take a note.

So I thought: I need something simple. Lightweight. No distractions.
Just a tool where I can quickly jot something down,
and then actually find it later without wondering when, where, or why I saved it.

In 2020, I made the first version — called it “Note Management”.
Pretty basic stuff: it just dumped some structured text into a file.
No hierarchy, no bells and whistles.  
And guess what? It actually helped.

After that, I built MemoKeeper, and then MemoKeeperX — a bit more advanced.
You could split notes into files, use tags, group stuff by topics, and so on.

And over time… I just started using it for everything:
pentesting, studying, random ideas, small projects — you name it.

It became part of my workflow.  
And no, it’s not just “creator bias” — it was genuinely useful.

So here comes NotaMy: a full rewrite of MemoKeeperX,
with some added features, a cleaner syntax,
and the same goal as always: make it dead simple to store and find your notes,
**without ever leaving the terminal**.

Why am I publishing it?
------------------------

Well, I’m not some expert dev — I do my best.  
But hey, maybe someone cooler than me will see the potential in the idea
and build on it.

Who knows — one day you might use **your** own version of NotaMy.
A simple, clean, no-bullshit tool that just does the job.

That’s the dream :)
