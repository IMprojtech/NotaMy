   cd NotaMy
   make
   ./bin/ntm
```

## üîó Making `NotaMy` Globally Available

After you compile `ntm`, you may want to run it from any directory without typing its full path. Here is a common approach:

### Install to a directory already in your PATH

1. Copy or move the compiled binary to a standard location, for example:

```sh
   sudo cp ./bin/ntm /usr/local/bin/
   sudo cp ./bin/ntm_nc /usr/local/bin/
```

or, if you prefer a user-local install (no `sudo` needed):

```sh
   mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
   cp ./bin/ntm "$HOME/.local/bin/"
   cp ./bin/ntm_nc "$HOME/.local/bin/"
```

Ensure that this directory is in your `PATH`. Most Linux distributions include `/usr/local/bin` by default. If you used `~/.local/bin`, make sure your shell initialization file adds it to `PATH`. For example, in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
   # Add this if not already present:
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

You can also simply add the bin directory of the project to your shell initialization file. For example:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/path/to/NotaMy/bin:$PATH"
```
